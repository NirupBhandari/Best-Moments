    <h1>About us</h1>
    <div class="about">
        <p>"Until you came into my world,

            there was nothing but darkness and gloom.

            My world was missing the clouds and the sun,

            and also the stars and the moon.

            I never believed in magic,

            but you just appeared from thin air.

            I thought I would only be lonely in life,

            but now I’m a complete pair.

            You make me who I am at this point,

            mold me in every way.

            There’s not a precious moment,

            where I do not want to give you my entire day.

            The passion between us is strong,

            ferocious to those that see.<br>

            The feelings that are shared between us.</p>

        <p>Me for you and you for me".</p>
        </p><br>
        <p> We are the two couples we met on this planet, and we love each other a lot. We met for the first time on
            December 22, 2022, and it was the best day of my life. After that, we came to know each other more. Many
            challenges had been encountered since the beginning, but we remained committed to one another. We know that
            we are not perfect; nobody is perfect. <br>We love each other genuinely, and we want to be together forever.
        </p>
